<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  A CSS framework is a library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language.
  Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid.
  More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns.
  This detail differentiates CSS frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.

<p>
  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
  This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
  css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
